Accept debit and credit cards in 135+ currencies, many local methods like Alipay, ACH, and SEPA, and express checkout with Apple Pay and Google Pay.

== Description ==

Changing consumer behavior has resulted in an explosion of payment methods and experiences, which are great for increasing conversion and lowering costs—but can be difficult for businesses to maintain. Give customers a best-in-class checkout experience while you remain focused on your core business. This is the official plugin created by Stripe and WooCommerce.

The enhanced checkout experience from Stripe can help customers:

- **Fight fraud:** Detect and prevent fraud with [Stripe Radar](https://stripe.com/radar), which offers seamlessly integrated, powerful fraud-detection tools that use machine learning to detect and flag potentially fraudulent transactions.
- **Accept in-person payments for products and services:** Use the Stripe Terminal M2 card reader or get started with no additional hardware using Tap to Pay on iPhone, or Tap to Pay on Android.
