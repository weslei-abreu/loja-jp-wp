----------------------------------
- **new:** [Auction] Added Single Step Product Creation feature for Auction Products
- **new:** [StripeExpress] Added a new hook named `dokan_stripe_express_account_capabilities` so that account capabilities values can be changed.
- **update:** Added refund request approval method ( Manual or via API ) choice added for Admin.
Previously, the admin only controlled the refund processing method (manual or via Payment Gateway API) through Admin settings and during sending a new refund request, the vendor had to make the choice for Manual or Refund through Payment Gateway API. But that is confusing for both the admin and vendors.
Now Admin has the choice to approve the process of the refund manually or through Payment Gateway API.
The Admin settings related to Refund via API have been completely removed, streamlining the functionality. Additionally, the code has been refactored to accommodate these changes and introduced a new filter called dokan_pro_automatic_process_api_refund_enabled. This filter allows programmatic control over the option to refund via API and comes with a default value of true.
Moreover, new features have been added to enhance the user experience. A new row action called "Refund via [Gateway Name]" (Like Refund via PayPal) has been introduced, specifically designed for the designated Payment Gateway that supports Rafund. Support for this action has also been integrated into the REST API. Furthermore, a new bulk action called "Refund via Payment Gateway" has been implemented, providing users with the ability to process refunds in bulk via the REST API.
To address performance issues, the codebase has been refactored to resolve the caching problem related to the get_items function, ensuring smoother operation. Additionally, the information pill displayed on the table header, which previously informed users about the activation of Refund via API admin settings, has been removed for a cleaner interface.
As for user interface improvements, the "Manual" pill has been replaced with a "Completed" tab, providing a clearer indication of the refund status. Moreover, the refund button's appearance and logic have been updated specifically for non-Dokan payment gateways, enhancing consistency throughout the platform.
These changes aim to enhance functionality, improve performance, and provide a more seamless experience for users utilizing refund-related features within the application.

- **update:** Added Enable/Disable option support for `Dokan New Support Ticket` and `Dokan Reply To Admin Support Ticket` email templates.
Previously, there were no settings to enable/disable these emails from email template settings under `WordPress Admin Dashboard → WooCommerce → Emails`. Though admin can control whether to send support notification emails from `WordPress Admin Dashboard → Dokan → Settings → Store Support Settings` by enabling the `Support Ticket Email Notification` setting. Now we’ve removed this setting and added an enable/disable option under the corresponding email template settings under WooCommerce Email Settings.
- **update:** [SellerVacation] We’ve rewritten the `Product Vacation Status` feature entirely for the `Seller Vacation` module.
Previously, when a vendor enabled `Vacation Mode` under `Vendor Dashboard → Settings → Store Settings → Go to Vacation` settings, all published product statuses changed to `vacation` and vacation status changed to `publish` when the vendor disabled this setting. This limitation affected SEO for that particular vendor since the web crawler found corresponding product URLs unavailable and marked those links as 404 URLs. To tackle this problem, we’ve removed the `vacation` status for products and enabled the `Catalog Mode` feature for the corresponding vendor products. Since products can’t be purchased if they are in catalog mode, the corresponding vendor can enjoy their vacation, and search engines will be able to index those products. If a vendor is on vacation mode and a user visits the single store page of that vendor, they will see a vacation mode notice set by the corresponding vendor.
- **fix:** [RFQ] Fixed an issue where the `Catalog Mode` settings were applied on the `Request For Quoto` rule, even though the vendor's catalog mode settings aren't enabled from the store settings.

- **update:** [VendorAnalytics] The date format for the “From” and “To” date pickers now matches the website’s date format.
Previously, these fields displayed dates in the default browser format of ‘yy-mm-dd’. This ensures consistency in the display of dates across the website.
- **update:** [RequestAQuote] Customers now receive an Order Confirmation email when their quote is converted to an order, providing clarity on the status of their quote.
Customers now receive a new Order Confirmation email when their quote is converted to an order. This update addresses previous uncertainty about the status of quotes by sending a notification to the customer as soon as their quote is approved and ready for payment.
- **fix:** [WPML] Fixed issue with WPML and Dokan where payment redirection and webhook URLs were being translated.
When the WPML plugin is set up with Dokan by the site admin and additional languages are added to the website, the payment redirection and webhook URLs displayed in both admin and vendor settings were being translated. However, for these URLs to work correctly, they need to remain in the website’s main language. We have made changes to ensure that these URLs do not get translated and remain correct.

This update extends the support for WooCommerce free shipping validation to include vendors using the Dokan shipping method, ensuring consistent validation across all vendor shipping options.

- **fix:** Resolved an issue with importing products on the vendor dashboard when using Arabic translation with Loco Translate.
It appears that there was a problem or bug when attempting to import products on the vendor dashboard, specifically when the site is translated into Arabic or other right-to-left (RTL) languages using the [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin and the [Automatic Translate Addon For Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-translator-addon-for-loco-translate/) plugin. However, the issue with the product import has been resolved and fixed.
- **fix:** [RequestForQuote] Quote Rules are applying for products under the vendor dashboard product listing page.
Vendors can now view their own product prices on the vendor product dashboard in the Dokan plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce. Previously, when a quotation rule was applied to a vendor, it prevented them from seeing their own product prices on the dashboard. This issue has been resolved, providing a more transparent experience for vendors using the plugin.
- **fix:** [StoreOpneCloseTime] Resolved an issue where vendors were unable to configure their store’s opening and closing times using a mobile device.
Previously, in the mobile responsive view, the open and close times were hidden and the time-picker was malfunctioning, preventing vendors from setting their store hours. This update ensures that vendors can now easily set their store hours using a mobile device.
- **fix:** [DokanRefund] Resolved an issue where the refund template did not allow for child theme overrides.
Previously, when a refund was processed, the Dokan template was always used instead of any customizations made in a child theme. This issue has been addressed by updating the load_order_items() function in ajax.php to check for a child theme version of the template before defaulting to the Dokan template.
- **fix:** [StoreReview] Resolved a translation issue where `Comment box is empty` string wasn’t translatable.
