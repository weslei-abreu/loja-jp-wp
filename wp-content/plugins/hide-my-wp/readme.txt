== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this plugin work on WP Multisite? =

Yes, the plugin works on WP Multisite and you will configure it for the entire network.

= Is WP Ghost working on Nginx Server? =

Yes, the plugin works on Nginx Server and you will be guided for the redirects and nginx.conf settings.

The plugin also works with Apache, IIS, and LiteSpeed servers

= My website theme is not loading correctly after I change the paths. What should I do? =

This issue is most likely from setting the rewritten rules.

1. Make sure you purge the cache if you have cache plugins after you save the WP Ghost settings.
2. In case the .htaccess (for apache) or nginx.conf (for Nginx) or web. config (for IIS) is not writable you need to add the rewrites manually.
3. If you have Nginx server make sure you reload the Nginx after you save the settings.
4. If the theme is still not loading okay, contact us and we can set up the plugin for you for free.

You can find useful information here: https://wpghost.com/kb/

= I forgot the custom login and admin URLs. What now? =

Don't panic.

You can still access your site with the Safe URL that was downloaded when you saved the settings

= Locked out of my site!  I set the plugin, and after I logged out I couldn't get back in =

Rename the plugin directory /wp-content/plugins/hide-my-wp so that the plugins won't hide the wp-login.php path anymore

Login using http://domainname/wp-login.php and activate the plugin again.

Make sure you remember the secure parameter and it will be much easier.

= Does WP Ghost work for the WordPress.com website? =

Because of the Jetpack security in the WordPress.com website, WP Ghost can't change the admin and login paths.

If you already activated Hide My Wp on WordPress.com, remove the directory /wp-content/plugins/hide-my-wp to disable the plugin.

= Will this plugin work if I don't have custom permalinks on my site? =

No. You need to have custom permalinks set to 'on' in Settings > Permalinks.

You will get a notification on the Settings page if something is not set upright.


= What do I need to do before I deactivate the plugin? =

It's better to switch to Default Mode in Settings > Hide My WP.

If you don't, the plugin will automatically change your site back to the safe URLs and it will tell you what to do if you don't have write permission for the config files

= How to Hide Your Site From WordPress Theme Detectors? =

Changing the common WordPress paths will not guarantee that the WordPress CMS is completely hidden.

The old paths are still accessible and hackers are still able to inject SQL and Javascript into vulnerable installed plugins and themes.

Read more: <a href="https://wpghost.com/kb/hide-from-wordpress-theme-detectors/" target="_blank">How to Hide Your Site From WordPress Theme Detectors</a>

= Is this plugin enough to protect my website from all hackers? =

The Free version of WP Ghost will not protect you from all hacker attacks. For extra security you need the premium version.

WP Ghost hides all the common paths and patterns used but bots to detect that you are using WordPress.

= How Can I Change The WP Paths In Admin Dashboard? =

By default, WP Ghost changes the paths only in frontend.

We don’t recommend this but if you want to change the path also in the admin dashboard, add this line in wp-config.php file

`define('HMW_ALWAYS_CHANGE_PATHS', true);`

Save the settings in WP Ghost and the WordPress paths will be changed in admin backend area.

= Why The New Admin Path Is Redirected To Front Page? =

By default, when you set WP Ghost plugin in Lite Mode, you can login only with the new login path.

To activate the option to access the new admin path and to be redirected to the new login path, do this:

Switch OFF the option <strong>WP Ghost > Change Paths > Admin Security > Hide the New Admin Path</strong>

Once you switch off the option and save the settings, when you access the new admin path, it will redirect to the new login path.
